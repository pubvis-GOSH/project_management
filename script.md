# Opening screen
	Hello and welcome to this puberty app
	Are you
•	A young person using the app?
•	A researcher/professional running a study ?
•	?? A clinician using the app ?(potential for a different mode from researcher but not sure this is necessary. Only potential benefit of this would be as the data wouldn’t necessarily need to be stored in this mode)
•	??(other modes e.g. developer - not sure if this would need to be ‘visible’ or would be access via other route)


# Researcher mode

## 1. Do you already have an account?
•	No, I need to set up a new account (a) OR
•	Yes, Previous user (b)

---

### 1a. New researcher account details [links to Database of users - ?need to consider information governance and storage of personal data of researchers as well]

•	Name 
•	Professional institution 
•	Email address – needed to log back in
•	Password – needed to log back in (need for password reset??)
•	Project reference number –to allow researchers to have more than one project associated with email
[AL –needs to consider management/permissions of this. Ie does someone need to authorize access (yes). Who (AL for time being, potential of external role if funded longer term)]

OR

### 1b. User login –[calling on data from database above]
•	Email address 
•	Password (with reset function?)
•	Project reference number 

---

## 2. Researcher mode options after login

•	(a) Generate unique id to provide to young people (ie each young person logs into the app themselves). Could this generate a unique QR code/weblink for the person specific ID? 
•	(b) Review data linked to my study 
•	(c) ???Review anonymized data from all studies (not sure if this is ethically an option yet)
•	Potentially alternative mode where the researcher logs in first then gets different young people to complete the app, with ID generated each time, but think this is not necessary and more complex, with concerns around information governance and ID

---------

### 2a. Please state the number of unique IDs you wish to generate (range e.g. 1-100 – to be set)

•	Please confirm the email address you want these IDs to be linked to (i.e. the app would then be able to email those IDs to the researcher)
(are there any options for giving unique web links for participants or QR codes instead of alphanumeric codes? )
(is there a way of resetting any IDs that aren’t used after e.g. 6-12 months?)

### 2b. Please confirm the project code you would like to review the data for 
(this would then bring up the completed anonymised data entries for that researcher and project code with unique ID. The unique id is linked to a researcher email so only the researcher would be able to access)
Option for this to be downloaded/emailed by researcher (and for this to be recorded on the researcher database)

### 2c??? anonymous data mode where a researcher can see anonymised data for all people who have used the app. Would be completely anonymised with unique id removed. 

--------

# Young person mode

1. Please type in the unique ID you have been given to start the app. (alternatively unique weblink or QR code)

[need to discuss options to allow people to leave part way through and return to the same record] 
[also to discuss options for repeat measurements for the same participant]

Eg. could we have ‘do you want to carry on with your previous go or start a new record?’ would need to think what is recorded for partly filled records

2. Welcome to PUBVIS.

The aim of this app is to give you all the information you need to be able to tell us the changes you have noticed in your body related to puberty. 

Before you start, it’s important you know why you are being asked to fill this in, and make sure you are happy to use the app. If you are, please press Yes.  If you are not, please press No. [pressing no would lead to a screen telling the young person that they couldn’t proceed unless they know why they are using the app.]

---------------
If yes…

This app will lead you through the different changes that happen in people’s bodies as they go through puberty. 

Everybody’s bodies are different and we want to understand the changes you have noticed. 

If you have any questions or concerns as a result of anything included in this app, please speak to the team who have asked you to complete it. 

-------------

To make sure we go through the appropriate changes, please first of all tell us whether you are male or female. This should be the sex that you were registered as at birth (discuss language). 
* Male [] Female []  (Possible need for third option – ‘Other’/Alternative answer)
This will then lead to different paths for males vs females. (If they choose other, could either taken them through the options that overlap for both, or would take to exit screen and explain why not possible to complete)
-

Next, please tell us your approximate height (possible information box – why do we want to know this
* m/ft inches
-

And your approximate weight (possible information box – why do we want to know this)
* kg/stone
-

[Calculate BMI]

-------


Thank you! We just need a few more bits of information. 

Please choose which of the skin tones (colours) that is closest to yours 
[multiple clickable boxes]

And please choose which of the hair colours is closest to yours 

--------------

Thank you. With all that information, we have now come up with some avatars that should look a bit like you. As everyone has different body shapes, please select which of the images below looks most like you. (need to decide if we can have a – none of them look like me option and what happens then)
