# Pubvis project management

A repository for managing the Pubvis project. Meeting notes and other documents related to the higher-level planning of the project will be stored here.

# Update 19.04.2024

We are using this repo less frequently now that we have adopted an Agile methodology. All project tasks are now stored as issue tickets and are dealt with in regular ceremonies.
