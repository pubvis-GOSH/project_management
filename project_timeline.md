A timeline of the pubvis project.

## Project start date

01.08.2023

## Proposed project end date

??

## App development

The app will be developed between August 2023 - August 2024.

We aim to have a finished working pilot by August 2024.

## Illustration development

Initial meetings for sharing ideas for the illustration development will start in late September 2023.

Initial prototype illustrations are expected mid-October 2023.

Refinement of the illustrations will continue throughout the main app development phase until August 2024.

## Young person recruitment

Recruitment will start in October 2023.

The young people will be between the ages of 16 - 19. This is so that they are close enough to puberty but also old enough to give effective feedback when using the app.

## Initial app piloting

The app will be piloted around months 10 - 12, so June 2024 - August 2024.

This will give us the opportunity to add any refinements and improvements that are needed before it is finalised.
